/**
 * Things you should think about as you attempt to create this class:
 * 1. How do you prevent users of your class from creating multiple instances? Why can't they
 * just invoke the constructor of your class multiple times?
 *
 * RESPONSE: Declaring the constructor private, no other classes can instantiate MySingleton which means that it is not possible
 *  to call multiple times.
 *
 *
 * 2. If two clients attempt to access an instance of your class, how can you guarantee they will
 * get the same instance?
 *
 * RESPONSE: By returning the same static final instance from getInstance().
 *
 * 3. How can you test your class to prove that it really is a Singleton?
 *
 * RESPONSE:
 *
 * Calling getInstance() from different references and checking if both references point to the same object using == or comparing hashcodes.
